# CTools Test Scripts

These Selenium-based test scripts were imported from their old location at:
<https://source.sakaiproject.org/contrib/umich/test-scripts/branches/selenium/keyword2/testScripts/CTools/2.9V>

Whenever changes are required for a new CTools release, the source should be "tagged" _after_ committing all your changes as follows:

* Select 'releases'
* Select 'Create a new release'
* Enter CTools version in 'Tag version' field (e.g. 'CTools 2.9U')
* Enter the same CTools version in the 'Release title' field
* Optionally enter a summary of the changes in the 'Describe this release' field
* Select 'Publish release'
